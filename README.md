Delete .mcp-onenote-cache.json to force re-authentication
Connection Issues
Check Claude Desktop logs for error messages
Verify the server path in your configuration
Ensure Node.js is installed and accessible
Common Errors
MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Run npm install to install dependencies
Invalid grant: Delete the token cache file and re-authenticate
Permission denied: Check Azure AD permissions
Security
Never commit your Azure Client ID to version control
The .mcp-onenote-cache.json file contains sensitive tokens - it's automatically excluded via .gitignore
Use environment variables or Claude Desktop's configuration for credentials
